# zombie-manager

A simple full-stack application using MongoDB, Express.js React.js and Node.js.

### Scenario:
We've got the zombies under control, but we need to keep track of them. That's where you come in. We need you to build an app for us. We need you to build a zombie manager.
We can quarantine zombies in three locations: the hospital, the school, and the warehouse. We need the app to keep track of where each zombie is being held, how many zombies are in each location, and we need to be able to move zombies between the locations.

*There is a seeds.js that creates the zombies data.*
